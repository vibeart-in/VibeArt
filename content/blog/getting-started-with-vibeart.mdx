### Creating Your First Image

1. Navigate to the creation page
2. Enter a detailed description of what you want to create
3. Choose your preferred style and settings
4. Click "Generate" and wait for the magic to happen

## Advanced Techniques

Once you're comfortable with the basics, try these advanced techniques.

### Using Negative Prompts

Negative prompts help you exclude unwanted elements from your images. For example:

```
Positive: "A serene mountain landscape at sunset"
Negative: "people, buildings, cars, text"
```

### Adjusting Generation Parameters

Fine-tune your results by adjusting:

- **Steps**: More steps = more refined results (but slower)
- **Guidance Scale**: Higher values follow your prompt more closely
- **Seed**: Use the same seed to reproduce results

### Combining Multiple Styles

You can blend different artistic styles for unique results:

```typescript
const styles = ["impressionist", "cyberpunk", "watercolor"];
const blendedStyle = styles.join(" + ");
```

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices for the best results.

### Composition Tips

- Use the rule of thirds for balanced compositions
- Consider lighting and shadows
- Think about color harmony
- Pay attention to focal points

### Iterative Refinement

Don't expect perfection on the first try. The creative process involves:

1. Generate an initial image
2. Analyze what works and what doesn't
3. Refine your prompt
4. Generate again with improvements
