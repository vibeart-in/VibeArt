We're excited to share all the amazing updates we've shipped this month! From powerful new AI models
to performance improvements, there's a lot to explore.

## 🚀 New AI Models

We've added three cutting-edge AI models to our platform.

### SDXL Turbo

Our fastest model yet! SDXL Turbo generates high-quality images in just 1-4 steps.

**Key benefits:**

- ⚡ 10x faster generation
- 🎨 Maintains quality
- 💰 Lower credit cost
- 🔄 Perfect for rapid iteration

<Callout type="success" title="Performance Boost">
  SDXL Turbo can generate images in under 2 seconds on average!
</Callout>

### Stable Cascade

A new architecture that excels at understanding complex prompts.

**What makes it special:**

- Better text rendering in images
- Improved prompt adherence
- Superior detail in complex scenes
- Enhanced color accuracy

### Custom Model Training

Now you can train your own models on your unique style!

```typescript
// Example: Training a custom model
interface ModelTrainingConfig {
  name: string;
  trainingImages: string[];
  baseModel: "sdxl" | "sd15" | "cascade";
  steps: number;
  learningRate: number;
}

const config: ModelTrainingConfig = {
  name: "my-art-style",
  trainingImages: ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"],
  baseModel: "sdxl",
  steps: 1000,
  learningRate: 0.0001,
};
```

## 🎨 Enhanced Editing Tools

We've completely revamped our editing suite.

### Inpainting 2.0

Our new inpainting tool is more precise and intuitive:

1. **Smart Selection**: AI-powered selection tools
2. **Context-Aware Fill**: Better understanding of surroundings
3. **Multiple Masks**: Work on several areas simultaneously
4. **History Panel**: Undo/redo with full history

### Advanced Color Grading

Professional-grade color correction tools:

- **LUT Support**: Import custom LUTs
- **Curves**: RGB and individual channel curves
- **Color Wheels**: Shadows, midtones, highlights
- **Presets**: One-click color grades

### Batch Processing

Process multiple images at once:

```python
# Batch processing example
images = ["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg"]
operations = [
    {"type": "upscale", "factor": 2},
    {"type": "enhance", "strength": 0.7},
    {"type": "style", "preset": "cinematic"}
]

results = batch_process(images, operations)
```

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

We've made VibeArt faster and more efficient.

### Generation Speed

| Model  | Previous | Now  | Improvement |

| SD 1.5 | 8s       | 5s   | 37% faster  |

| Turbo  | 4s       | 1.8s | 55% faster  |

### Memory Optimization

## 🔧 Developer Features

New tools for developers and power users.

### API v2

Our new API is more powerful and easier to use:

```javascript
// New API v2 syntax
import { VibeArtClient } from "@vibeart/sdk";

const client = new VibeArtClient({
  apiKey: process.env.VIBEART_API_KEY,
});

// Generate an image
const result = await client.generate({
  prompt: "A serene mountain landscape",
  model: "sdxl-turbo",
  size: "1024x1024",
  steps: 4,
});

// Download the result
await result.download("output.png");
```

### Webhooks

Get notified when generation completes:

```typescript
interface WebhookPayload {
  event: "generation.completed" | "generation.failed";
  imageId: string;
  url: string;
  metadata: {
    prompt: string;
    model: string;
    duration: number;
  };
}

// Register a webhook
await client.webhooks.create({
  url: "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  events: ["generation.completed"],
});
```

### CLI Tool

New command-line interface for automation:

```bash
# Install the CLI
