# Welcome to the Test Post

This is a test blog post to verify that our MDX parsing utilities are working correctly.

## Features

- MDX parsing
- Frontmatter extraction
- Reading time calculation
- Content processing

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

This post contains enough content to test the reading time calculation and excerpt generation
features.
